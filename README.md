Baseball Tracker
================

For a recent job interview, I was tasked with creating an interface to the Major League Baseball API. I chose to use Rails and Angular.js.

The app needed to fetch the games for a given day, and display the home/away teams, the score, and the outcome - A surprising amount of games get rescheduled or canceled, but I'm not really a baseball fan so I won't speculate.

Additionally, since we're in Toronto, any game featuring the Blue Jays needed to be pulled to the top of the list, and the list needed to be sortable by date; both with next/previous buttons, and by entering a specific date.

Time of execution: 1 hour 20 minutes.
Were this to be a real app, I'd polish a lot of things. It's calling out for a datepicker, for one!
